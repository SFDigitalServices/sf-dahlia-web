; It is acceptable and often preferred to leave certain EditorConfig properties unspecified. For example tab_width need not be specified unless it differs from the value of indent_size. Also when indent_style is set to tab it may be desirable to leave indent_size unspecified so readers may view the file using their preferred indentation format. Additionally if a property is not standardized in your project (end_of_line for example) it may be best to leave it blank.

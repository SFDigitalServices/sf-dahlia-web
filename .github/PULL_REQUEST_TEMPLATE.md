- [ ] code irrelevant to the ticket is not modified e.g. changing indentation due to automated formatting
- [ ] if the code changes the UI, it matches the UI design exactly
- [ ] if the PR is a bugfix, there are tests and logs around the bug

### Review instructions

- [ ] instructions specify which environment(s) it applies to
- [ ] instructions work for PA testers

### Request eng review

## Before merging

### Request product acceptance testing

- [ ] Code change is behind a feature flag
- [ ] If code change is not behind a feature flag, it has been PA tested in the review environment (use `needs product acceptance` label to indicate that the PR is waiting for PA testing)

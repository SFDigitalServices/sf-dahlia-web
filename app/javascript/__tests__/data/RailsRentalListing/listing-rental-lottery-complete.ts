  Credit_Rating:
    "If an applicant has a derogatory credit history that includes a TransUnion Resident Score of 620 or lower (not to be confused with a FICO or other generic consumer score) the following factors will be reviewed: the maximum number of derogatory accounts cannot exceed 25%; the maximum balance of unpaid accounts, including past due accounts, cannot exceed $2500. If the applicant meets these requirements, then a higher deposit of one month’s rent will be required. If not, the application will be denied. Student debt, medical-related collections, lack of credit, or a resolved bankruptcy is not a reason for denial. A bankruptcy in process will result in denial of the\r\nApplication. 7 years of credit history are reviewed, but the most recent 3 years are more heavily weighted.",
  Eviction_History:
    "– Depending on the results of the credit report, applicants may be required to provide proof of income and satisfactory residential history such as recent rental or mortgage history. More than 6 late or returned payments within the last 12 months will result in a denial. Rental history verification will only be for documented lease violations and for-cause evictions (no fault evictions will not be held against a household). No more than 3 years of rental history will be reviewed.",

{"message":"VCR::Errors::UnhandledHTTPRequestError, \n\n================================================================================\nAn HTTP request has been made that VCR does not know how to handle:\n  GET https://sfhousing--full.cs77.my.salesforce.com/services/apexrest/ListingDetails?childrenUnder6=1&householdsize=2&incomelevel=20000.0&type\n\nVCR is currently using the following cassette:\n  - /Users/Martin/developer/exygy/sf-dahlia-web/spec/vcr/listings/eligibility.yml\n    - :record => :once\n    - :match_requests_on => [:method, :uri]\n\nUnder the current configuration VCR can not find a suitable HTTP interaction\nto replay and is prevented from recording new requests. There are a few ways\nyou can deal with this:\n\n  * If you're surprised VCR is raising this error\n    and want insight about how VCR attempted to handle the request,\n    you can use the debug_logger configuration option to log more details [1].\n  * You can use the :new_episodes record mode to allow VCR to\n    record this new request to the existing cassette [2].\n  * If you want VCR to ignore this request (and others like it), you can\n    set an `ignore_request` callback [3].\n  * The current record mode (:once) does not allow new requests to be recorded\n    to a previously recorded cassette. You can delete the cassette file and re-run\n    your tests to allow the cassette to be recorded with this request [4].\n  * The cassette contains 1 HTTP interaction that has not been\n    played back. If your request is non-deterministic, you may need to\n    change your :match_requests_on cassette option to be more lenient\n    or use a custom request matcher to allow it to match [5].\n\n[1] https://www.relishapp.com/vcr/vcr/v/4-0-0/docs/configuration/debug-logging\n[2] https://www.relishapp.com/vcr/vcr/v/4-0-0/docs/record-modes/new-episodes\n[3] https://www.relishapp.com/vcr/vcr/v/4-0-0/docs/configuration/ignore-request\n[4] https://www.relishapp.com/vcr/vcr/v/4-0-0/docs/record-modes/once\n[5] https://www.relishapp.com/vcr/vcr/v/4-0-0/docs/request-matching\n================================================================================\n\n","status":503}

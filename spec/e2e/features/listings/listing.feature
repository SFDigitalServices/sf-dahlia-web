# We have fully transitioned to React for Listing and Home pages, so these Angular pages do not need to be tested

# Feature: Listings
#  As a web user
#  I should be able to view a listing

#  Scenario: Attempting to go to a listing page using an invalid ID
#    Given I try to go to a listing page with an invalid ID
#    Then I should be redirected to the welcome page

#  Scenario: Viewing and interacting with a listing page
#    Given I go to the "Test Listing" listing page
#    And I click the Download Application button
#    Then I should see at least one paper application download link

#  Scenario: Going to the Ownership listings page from the welcome page
#    Given I go to the welcome page
#    Then I should see the Buy link
#    And I click the Buy link
#    Then I should be on the Ownership listings page
